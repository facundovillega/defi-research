## Abstract

This paper develops a formal theoretical framework for monetary markets in which a fraction λ of the deposit stock is managed by autonomous contracts — Programmatic Deposit Agents (PDAs) — that execute predefined logic without continuous human intervention. The entry and exit thresholds of PDAs are derived as optimal solutions to an (S,s) inventory policy problem with asymmetric activation costs, not as *ad hoc* assumptions.

Five propositions with quantitative and falsifiable implications are established: the entry elasticity exceeds the exit elasticity by a ratio empirically identified at 8.44; the stock persists under negative spread for a finite and derivable interval; event studies underestimate long-run passthrough by a factor proportional to 1−δ; stock variance under migration shocks is increasing in concentration; and the monetary lever of the issuer fragments when two instruments with diverging rates coexist.

Empirical evidence comes from MakerDAO's Pot (2023–2025): 17.572M DAI persistent under negative DSR/Aave USDC spread in 2H2025, with λ≈0.86 and δ=0.5703 identified on sDAI microdata. The DSR/Aave USDC spread is the dominant predictor of governance adjustments (β=0.64, p=0.003, R²=0.353). The Surplus Buffer — operationalized as weekly flap auction frequency — precedes DSR adjustments with a 1-week lag.
